    <h2 class="font-effect-anaglyph">how I started watching</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>childhood</h3>
      <p>
        You know I liked to watch cartoons when I was a kid, you know tom and tom&jerry, mickey mouse and so but
        sometimes
        anime like naruto, one-piece, Conan and Digimon
      </p>
      <p>
        But you can't consider that as watching anime, those versions of the shows weren't the original ones
      </p>
      <p>
        when I was older, I had some friends who watched anime, and they were talking to me about how anime is amazing,
        but I wasn't even interested in this, who on earth would be interested in watching 500 episodes or 700 episodes
        or
        1000 episodes? That person is not me of course, so I let them told me the stories of that animes insteed.

      <h3>detective Conan</h3>
      <p>
        One day I watched an episode on tv of "detective Conan" show by chance, and how amazing it was, I really enjoyed
        it, it was about the black organization
      </p>
      <p>
        But of course, I won't watch the 900 episodes, most of these episodes are boring and has no effect on the main
        story so I found a solution, and I just watched 184 episodes.

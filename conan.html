      <h3>introduction</h3>
      <p>you don't want to watch 1000 episodes,
        most of these episodes are boring and do
        es not affect the main story so I
        found a solution
      </p>
      <P>
        the solution is very simple, you can just watch the important episodes and ignore the rest of them
        ,so how can you know which episodes are important and which are not?
      </P>

        organization episodes are colored with blue, the non-black organization episodes but It has an effect on the
        story are colored green, the non-story episodes but are good enough to watch are colores orange and the trach
        episodes are colored gray and every episode is rated consider to the writer of the table opinion and he also

      <p>
        you can now know chose the episodes that you want to watch and I advise you to do what I did which is just
        watching the black organization episodes and some of the green episodes and Kaito kid's episodes that maybe 180
        episodes approximately
      </p>
      <p>
        you can also use those links to help you chose the episodes
        they are maybe better than the last table
